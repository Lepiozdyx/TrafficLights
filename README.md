# Traffic Light App

*This is a simple tutorial iOS application written in Swift that simulates a traffic light. The user can tap the "START" button to switch the light from red to green via a yellow intermediate state. The app also displays a message that corresponds to the current color of the light.*

**Tech Stack**

- Swift
- UIKit

**Goals Achieved**

- Using enums to represent state
- Animating view properties using UIView animation functions
- Updating the text and attributes of labels and buttons programmatically
- Working with view constraints and layout
- Using IBOutlet and IBAction to connect view components to code
- Additionally, this application allowed me to practice the following software development concepts:

Following good coding practices like proper code organization and documentation
Using version control tools like Git and Github to manage code changes and collaborate with others
Debugging code using print statements and Xcode debugger
Creating and running iOS applications on both simulator and physical devices
Overall, this app has helped me to improve my Swift programming skills and deepen my understanding of iOS development concepts.
